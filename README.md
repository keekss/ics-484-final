# ICS 484 Final Project

### Reddit Sentiment and Stock Price

The first part of this project is a python notebook consisting of a pipeline to get content from Reddit and the stock market, perform sentiment 
analysis on the content, then graph the two datasets. This notebook is fairly robust - each process takes in an iput file and writes to an output 
file, allowing you to enter the pipeline at any point and checkpoint as you go. 

All of the necessary code for this can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/keekss/ics-484-final/blob/main/Reddit_Sentiment_vs_Stock_API.ipynb), 
which can be run as a Jupyter notebook on a local machine or through Google Colab. It was originally developed in Google Colab, so if the size of the 
dataset you wish to work with is small enough to run in Google Colab, that platform might be best. NOTE: every time this notebook is restarted in Google 
Colab, all of the pip installations need to be rerun. 

The final section of the notebook contains driver code to reconstruct our sample graphs using prepared data files, which can be found in the 
[sampleData](https://github.com/keekss/ics-484-final/tree/main/sampleData) directory. These graphs get posts and comments from 
[r/disney](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/) and plots their sentiment alongside Disney stock.
